    - Self-appraisal
    - 360-degree feedback
    - Management by objectives (MBO)
    - Rating scales

### Job Rotation
**Moving employees to different jobs** within the company regularly.  
**Why?** To learn new skills and avoid boredom.

### Job Enrichment
**Adding more interesting tasks and responsibility** to a job.  
**Why?** To make work more fun and motivating.


#### Human Resource Planning
Ensuring that the organization has the right number and kinds of capable people in the right places and at the right time.

Two steps:
- Assessing current human resources
- Meeting future HR needs

#### Current Assessment
- **Job Analysis:** An assessment that defines jobs and the behaviour necessary to perform them.
- **Job Description:** A written statement that describes a job.
- **Job Specifications:** A written statement of the minimum qualifications a person must possess to perform a given job successfully.

#### Meeting Future Needs
- Future HR needs a determined by the organization's mission goals and strategies.
- Companies that do not carefully scrutinize the qualifications or backgrounds of employees surely pose risks of increased liability, poor reputation and lower performance.


#### What is?
- **Recruitment**: locating, identifying, and attracting capable applicants
- **Decruitment**: reducing an organization’s workforce
- **Selection**: screening job applicants to ensure that the most appropriate candidates are hired

#### Validity and Reliability
- A valid selection device is characterized by a proven relationship between the selection device and some relevant criterion.
- A reliable selection device indicates that it measures the same thing consistently.

- **Orientation**: introducing a new employee to his or her job and the organization
- **Work unit orientation:** familiarizes employees with the goal of the work unit and their specific job
- **Organization orientation:** informs employees about the company’s goals, history, philosophy, procedures and rules
