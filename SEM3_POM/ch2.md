#### Scientific Managment (Taylor) 
- Develop a science for each element of an individual's work, which will replace the old rule of thumb method.
- Scientifically select and then train, teach, and develop the worker.
- Heartily cooperate with the workers so as to ensure that all work is done in accordance with the principles of the science that has been developed.
- Divided work and responsibility almost equally between managment and workers. Managment takes over all work for which it is better fitted than the workers.


General Administrative Theory
- Henri Fayol: Believed that the practice of management was distinct from other organizational functions. Developed  principles of management that applied to all organizational situations.
- Max Weber: Developed a theory of authority based on an ideal type of organization (bureaucracy). Emphasized rationality, predictability, impersonality, technical competence, and authoritarianism



#### Bureaucracy (Weber)
- Division in labor: Jobs broken down into simple routine.
- Authority Hierarchy: Positions organized in hierarchy with a clear chain on cmd.
- Formal Selection: People selected for jobs based on technical qualifications.
- Formal Rules and Regulations: System of written rules and standard operating procedures.
- Impersonality: Uniform application of rules and controls, not according to personalities.
- Career Orientation: Managers are career professionals, not owners of units they manage. 


#### 14 Principles/Process of Managment (Fayol)
1. Division of work. Specialization increases output by making employees more efficient.
    
2. Authority. Managers must be able to give orders, and authority gives them this right.
    
3. Discipline. Employees must obey and respect the rules that govern the organization.
    
4. Unity of command. Every employee should receive orders from only one superior.
    
5. Unity of direction. The organization should have a single plan of action to guide managers and workers.
    
6. Subordination of individual interests to the general interest. The interests of any one employee or group of employees should not take precedence over the interests of the organization as a whole.
    
7. Remuneration. Workers must be paid a fair wage for their services.
    
8. Centralization. This term refers to the degree to which subordinates are involved in decision-making.
    
9. Scalar chain. The line of authority from top management to the lowest ranks is the scalar chain.
    
10. Order. People and materials should be in the right place at the right time.
    
11. Equity. Managers should be kind and fair to their subordinates.
    
12. Stability of tenure of personnel. Management should provide orderly personnel planning and ensure that replacements are available to fill vacancies.
    
13. Initiative. Employees allowed to originate and carry out plans will exert high levels of effort.
    
14. Esprit de corps. Promoting team spirit will build harmony and unity within the organization.

#### Systems Approach Theory
A set of interrelated and interdependent parts arranged in a manner that produces a unified whole.

###### Basic Types of Systems
- **Closed Systems**: Are not influenced by and do not interact with their environment (all system input and output are internal). Ex: Schools, Rolls Royce and University. They don't change their system rapidly and follow same system and process for long run.
	- Environment/System/1. Input, 2. Transformation Process, 3. Outputs
- **Open Systems**: Dynamically interact to their environments by taking in inputs and transforming them in to outputs that are distributed into their environments. Ex: Apple, Samsung, Noon which adapts themselves based on customer requirements. 

###### Implications of the Systems Approach
- Coordination of the organization's parts is essential for proper functioning of the entire organization.
- Decision and actions taken in one area of the organization will have an effect in other areas of the organization.
- Organizations are not self-contained and therefore, must adapt to changes in their external environment.

#### Organizational Behaviour Theory
The study of the actions of people at work, people are the most important asset of an organizational.

###### Early Advocates of Organizational Behaviour
- Robert Owen Late 1700s
- Hugo Munsterberg Early 1900s
- Mary Parker Follett Early 1900s
- Chester Barnard 1930s


#### Contingency Approach Theory
- Also sometimes called the situational approach. There is no one universally applicable set of managment principles by which to manage organizations.
- Organizations are individually different, face different situations and require different ways of managing.

###### Popular Contingency Variables
- **Organization Size**: As size increases so do the problems of coordination.
- **Routineness of task technology**: Routine technologies require organizational structures, leadership styles, and control system that are differ from those required by customized or non-routine technologies.
- **Environmental uncertainty**: What works best in a stable and predictable environment may be totally inappropriate in a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment. Not only weather but it could be anything political, economical, trade.
- **Individual differences**: Individual differ in terms of their desire for growth, autonomy, tolerance of ambiguity, and expectations.
