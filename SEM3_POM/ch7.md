## Communication
- Communication: the transfer and understanding of meaning

Interpersonal communication: communication between two or more people
Organizational communication: all the patterns, networks, and systems of communication within an organization


###### Functions of Communication
- Control
- Motivation
- Emotional Expression
- Information

###### Methods of Communication
- Oral Communication
- Written Communication
- Nonverbal Communication

###### The Communication Process
Source -> Encoding -> Channel -> Decoding -> Receiver
then Receiver -> Source

###### Types of Communication
- **Nonverbal communication**: communication transmitted without words
	- **Body language**: gestures, facial configurations, and other body movements that convey meaning
	- **Verbal intonation**: an emphasis given to words or phrases that conveys meaning
- **Formal communication**: communication that takes place within prescribed organizational work arrangements
- **Informal communication**: communication that is not defined by the organization’s structural hierarchy

#### Barriers
- **Information overload**: when information exceeds our processing capacity
- **Filtering**: the deliberate manipulation of information to make it appear more favorable to the receiver
- **Jargon**: specialized terminology or technical language that members of a group use to communicate among themselves
>> *ADDITIONAL BARRIERS*
- Emotions
- Silence
- National Culture

###### Overcoming the Barriers
- Use feedback
- Simplify Language
- Listen Actively (**Active Listening**: listening for full meaning without making premature judgments or interpretations)
- Constrain Emotions
- Watch nonverbal cues

#### Direction of Communication 
- **Downward**: communication that flows downward from a manager to employees
- **Town hall meeting**: informal public meetings where information can be relayed, issues can be discussed, or employees can be brought together to celebrate accomplishments
- **Upward communication**: communication that flows upward from employees to managers
- **Lateral communication**: communication that takes place among any employees on the same organizational level
- **Diagonal communication**: communication that cuts across work areas and organizational levels

#### Networks
- **Communication networks**: the variety of patterns of vertical and horizontal flows of organizational communication
- **Grapevine**: the informal organizational communication network

## Motivation

16.1 Compare and contrast early theories of motivation.
16.2 Compare and contrast contemporary theories of motivation. 
16.34 Discuss current issues in motivation.


#### Motivation Theories
- **Motivation**: the process by which a person’s efforts are energized, directed, and sustained toward attaining a goal
- **Hierarchy of needs theory**: Maslow’s theory that human needs - form a sort of hierarchy physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization

#### 1. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
- Self Actualization
- Esteem
- Social
- Safety
- Physiological

###### Maslow Levels
- **Physiological needs**: a person’s needs for food, drink, shelter, sexual satisfaction, and other physical needs
- **Safety needs**: a person’s needs for security and protection from physical and emotional harm
- **Social needs**: a person’s needs for affection, belongingness, acceptance, and friendship
- **Esteem needs**: a person’s needs for internal factors such as self-respect, autonomy, and achievement, and external factors such as status, recognition, and attention
- **Self-actualization needs**: a person’s need to become what he or she is capable of becoming

#### McGregor’s Theory X and Theory
- **Theory X**: the assumption that employees dislike work, are lazy, avoid responsibility, and must be coerced to perform
- **Theory Y**: the assumption that employees are creative, enjoy work, seek responsibility, and can exercise self-direction


#### Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory
- **Hygiene factors**: factors that eliminate job dissatisfaction, but don’t motivate
- **Motivators**: factors that increase job satisfaction and motivation

| Motivators    | Hygiene Factors                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Achievement   | Supervision                    |
| Recognition   | Company Policy                 |
| Work Itself   | Relationship with Supervisor   |
| Advancement   | Working conditions             |
| Growth        | Salary                         |
|               | Relationship with peers        |
|               | Personal Life                  |
|               | Relationship with subordinates |
|               | Status                         |
|               | Security                       |
|               |                                |
| **Satisfied** | **Dissatisfied**               |


#### Exhibit -Contrasting Views of Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction

As shown in Exhibit -Herzberg proposed that a dual continuum existed: The opposite of “satisfaction” is “no satisfaction,” and the opposite of “dissatisfaction” is “no dissatisfaction.”

| Traditional View                         | Herzberg's View                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only 2 Sides, Satisfied and Dissatisfied | 4 sides, Satisfaction, No Satisfaction, No Dissatisfaction, Dissatisfaction |

#### Three Needs Theory (McGregor's)
- **Three-needs theory**: the motivation theory that says three acquired (not innate) needs— achievement, power, and affiliation—are major motives in work
- **Need for achievement (nAch)**: the drive to succeed and excel in relation to a set of standards
- **Need for power (nPow)**: the need to make others behave in a way that they would not have behaved otherwise
- **Need for affiliation (nAff)**: the desire for friendly and close interpersonal relationships

#### Contemporary Theories
- Goal Setting Theory
- Reinforcement Theory
- Equity Theory
- Expectancy Theory

#### Goal Setting Theories
- **Goal-setting theory**: the proposition that specific goals increase performance and that difficult goals, when accepted, result in higher performance than do easy goals
 - **Self-efficacy**: an individual’s belief that he or she is capable of performing a task



#### Reinforcement Theory 
- **Reinforcement theory**: the theory that behavior is a function of its consequences
- **Reinforcers**: consequences immediately following a behavior, which increase the probability that the behavior will be repeated

#### Designing Motivating Jobs
- **Job design**: the way tasks are combined to form complete jobs
- **Job scope**: the number of different tasks required in a job and the frequency with which those tasks are repeated
- **Job enlargement**: the horizontal expansion of a job by increasing job scope
- **Job enrichment**: the vertical expansion of a job by adding planning and evaluating responsibilities
- **Job depth**: the degree of control employees have over their work
- **Job characteristics model (J C M)**: a framework for analyzing and designing jobs that identifies five primary core job dimensions, their interrelationships, and their impact on outcomes

#### Five core job dimension
- Skill variety: the degree to which a job requires a variety of activities so that an employee can use a number of different skills and talents
- Task identity: the degree to which a job requires completion of a whole and identifiable piece of work
- Task significance: the degree to which a job has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people
- Autonomy: the degree to which a job provides substantial freedom, independence, and discretion to the individual in scheduling work and determining the procedures to be used in carrying it out
- Feedback: the degree to which carrying out work activities required by a job results in the individual’s obtaining direct and clear information about his or her performance effectiveness

#### Redesigning Job design approaches
- Relational perspective of work design: an approach to job design that focuses on how people’s tasks and jobs are increasingly based on social relationships
- Proactive perspective of work design: an approach to job design in which employees take the initiative to change how their work is performed
- High-involvement work practices: work practices designed to elicit greater input or involvement from workers
#### Leadership
17.1 Define leader and leadership.
17.2 Compare and contrast early theories of leadership.
17.3 Describe the three major contingency theories of leadership.
17.4 Describe contemporary views of leadership.
17.5 Compare the various theories of leadership for their validity.
17.6 Discuss twenty-first century issues affecting leadership.

- Leader: someone who can influence others and who has managerial authority
- Leadership: a process of influencing a group to achieve goals
- TRAITS Research focused on identifying personal characteristics that differentiated leaders from non-leaders was unsuccessful who can influence others and who has managerial authority.
It proved impossible to identify a set of traits that would always differentiate a leader (the person) from a nonleader of influencing a group to achieve goals.

#### Difference between a LEADER and a MANAGER

| LEADER                                                                                                                                                                                           | MANAGER                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A person who emerges as a leader.                                                                                                                                                                | A manager is always put into his position by appointment.                                                                                                      |
| A leader always has some personal power (i.e., ability to influence) that enables him to lead.                                                                                                   | A manager always has some positional power. He may or may not have personal power.                                                                             |
| A leader focuses on people and generally seeks those very objectives which are the objectives of his followers. Thus, there is mutuality of objectives between the leader and his followers.<br> | A manager focuses on systems and structures and seeks those objectives which his subordination do not regard as their own. Thus, there is clash of objectives. |
