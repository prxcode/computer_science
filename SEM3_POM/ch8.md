#### Controlling
Managment function that involves monitoring, comparing, and correcting work performance.

###### Why is controlling important?
- Planning
- Empowering employees
- Protecting the workplace

#### The Control Process
- **Control process:** a three-step process of measuring actual performance, comparing actual performance against a standard, and taking managerial action to correct deviations or inadequate standards
- The Control Process
	1. STEP 1: Measuring Actual Performance
		- How we measure
		- What we measure
	2. STEP 2: Comparing Actual Performance Against Standard
		- **Range of variation:** the acceptable parameters of variance between actual performance and the standard
		- **Manager’s Responsibility:**  The manager needs to ensure that actual observations remain within the accepted range of variation.
		- The chart displays **Time Period (t)** on the x-axis, showing the points: _t, t+1, t+2, t+3, t+4, t+5_. The y-axis represents **Measurement of Performance**, with three key values: _Acceptable Lower Limit_, _Standard_, and _Acceptable Upper Limit_. The _Acceptable Lower Limit_ and _Acceptable Upper Limit_ are equidistant below and above the _Standard_, respectively.
		- Six plots indicate the **Performance** at each time point. All plots lie within the _Acceptable Lower Limit_ and _Acceptable Upper Limit_. A line passes through these plots, illustrating the trend over time. The space between the _Acceptable Lower Limit_ and _Acceptable Upper Limit_ is labeled as the **Acceptable Range of Variation**.
	3. STEP 3: Taking Managerial Action
		- **Correct actual performance**
			- **Immediate corrective action:** corrective action that corrects problems at once to get performance back on track
			- **Basic corrective action:** corrective action that looks at how and why performance deviated before correcting the source of deviation
- Revise the Standard
	- If performance consistently exceeds the goal, then a manager should look at whether the goal is too easy and needs to be raised.
	- Managers must be cautious about revising a standard downward.
- Managerial Decisions in Controlling
	- Depending on the results, a manager’s decision is to do nothing, correct the performance, or revise the standard.

#### What is Organizational Performance?
- **Performance**: the end result of an activity
- **Organizational performance**: the accumulated results of all the organization’s work activities
#### Measures of Organizational Performance
- Organizational Productivity: the amount of goods or services produced divided by the inputs needed to generate that output
- Organizational effectiveness: a measure of how appropriate organizational goals are and how well those goals are being met

#### Controlling for Employee Performance
- Disciplinary action: actions taken by a manager to enforce the organization’s work standards and regulations
- Progressive disciplinary action: an approach to ensure that the minimum penalty appropriate to the offense is imposed

#### Feedforward/Concurrent/Feedback Controls
- Feedforward control: control that takes place before a work activity is done
- Concurrent control: control that takes place while a work activity is in progress
- Management by walking around: a term used to describe when a manager is out in the work area interacting directly with employees
- Feedback control: control that takes place after a work activity is done

#### Financial Controls
- Traditional controls
	- Ratio analysis:
		- Liquidity
		- Leverage
		- Activity
		- Profitability
	- Budget analysis:
		- Quantitative standards
		- Deviations

#### Information Controls
- Management information system (M I S): a system used to provide management with needed information on a regular basis
- Data versus information

#### Balanced Scorecard
- **Balanced scorecard**: a performance measurement tool that looks at more than just the financial perspective

#### Benchmarking of Best Practices
- Benchmarking: a performance measurement tool that looks at more than just the financial perspective
- Benchmark: the standard of excellence against which to measure and compare


#### Social Media as a Control Tool
- Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms can be a valuable tool to gather feedback
- Recent examples helped government officials provide flood and fire information and direct resources during natural disasters

#### Global Differences in Control
- Distance creates formalized controls, e.g. formal reports
- Impact of technology
- Constraints due to local laws
- Comparability issues in data collection
- Be prepared for global turmoil and disasters

#### Workplace Privacy
- Employers can read your email, tap your telephone, monitor your work by computer, store and review computer files.
- Reasons companies monitor:
	- Productivity/internet traffic
	- Concerns about offensive/inappropriate material
	- Protecting company secrets

#### Employee Theft
- **Employee theft**: any unauthorized taking of company property by employees for their personal use

## **Management 4 Categories**

Management involves planning, organizing, leading, and controlling.

1. **Planning**
    
    - Defining objectives and determining the best course of action to achieve them.
        
    - Example: A smartphone company planning the launch of a new model after analyzing market demand.
        
2. **Organizing**
    
    - Arranging resources and tasks to achieve objectives efficiently.
        
    - Example: Assigning teams for R&D, marketing, and production for a product launch.
        
3. **Leading**
    
    - Motivating, directing, and influencing employees to achieve organizational goals.
        
    - Example: A CEO inspiring employees to innovate in a competitive tech market.
        
4. **Controlling**
    
    - Monitoring, comparing, and correcting work performance to ensure goals are achieved.

## **Controlling**

**Definition:** Management function that involves **monitoring, comparing, and correcting work performance** to achieve organizational goals.

### **Why is Controlling Important?**

- **Planning:** Ensures plans are implemented correctly.
- **Empowering Employees:** Gives feedback to guide performance.
- **Protecting the Workplace:** Identifies and corrects deviations before they become problems.

---

## **The Control Process**

**Control** is a continuous process with three main steps:

### **STEP 1: Measuring Actual Performance**

- **How we measure:** Using reports, observations, audits, or automated systems.
- **What we measure:** Productivity, quality, time, cost, employee behavior, and customer satisfaction.
- **Example:** Measuring sales targets against actual sales per month.
    

### **STEP 2: Comparing Actual Performance Against Standard**

- **Range of Variation:** Acceptable limits within which actual performance can fluctuate.
- **Manager’s Responsibility:** Ensure actual results remain within the acceptable range.
- **Illustration:**
    - X-axis: **Time Period (t)** → t, t+1, t+2, t+3, t+4, t+5
    - Y-axis: **Measurement of Performance** → Acceptable Lower Limit, Standard, Acceptable Upper Limit
    - Performance plots within limits show trends and deviations.
    - Gap between lower and upper limits = **Acceptable Range of Variation**.

### **STEP 3: Taking Managerial Action**

1. **Correct Actual Performance**
    - **Immediate corrective action:** Fixes a problem right away (e.g., repairing a machine that stopped working).
    - **Basic corrective action:** Addresses the root cause to prevent recurrence (e.g., changing the workflow that caused repeated errors).
        
2. **Revise the Standard**
    - If performance consistently exceeds goals → raise the standard.
    - Avoid lowering standards unnecessarily, as it reduces performance expectations.
    
3. **Managerial Decisions in Controlling**
    - Options: Do nothing, correct performance, or revise the standard based on results.

---

## **Organizational Performance**
- **Performance:** End result of an activity.
- **Organizational Performance:** Accumulated results of all organizational activities.

### **Measures of Organizational Performance**
1. **Organizational Productivity:** Output produced ÷ Inputs used.
    - Example: A factory produces 1000 units using 500 hours of labor → productivity = 2 units/hour.
    
2. **Organizational Effectiveness:** How well organizational goals are achieved.
    - Example: A company aims for customer satisfaction → measured by repeat purchases and feedback ratings.


---

## **Controlling Employee Performance**
- **Disciplinary Action:** Enforcing work standards and regulations.
- **Progressive Disciplinary Action:** Applying penalties gradually depending on the severity and recurrence of violations.
    

---

## **Types of Controls**
1. **Feedforward Control:** Before a task begins.
    - Example: Checking project design before production starts.
2. **Concurrent Control:** During the task.
    - Example: Manager walks around the work area to monitor employees (Management by Walking Around – MBWA).
3. **Feedback Control:** After the task is completed.
    - Example: Customer feedback surveys used to improve next product batch.

---

## **Financial Controls**
- **Traditional Controls:**
    1. **Ratio Analysis** – Measures financial performance:
        - Liquidity, Leverage, Activity, Profitability
            
    2. **Budget Analysis** – Compares actual costs vs. budgeted costs; identifies deviations

---

## **Information Controls**

- **Management Information System (MIS):** Provides managers with regular information to make decisions.
- **Data vs. Information:** Raw numbers = data; processed data = information used for decision-making.

---

## **Balanced Scorecard**
- Performance measurement tool looking beyond financials:
    - Financial perspective, customer perspective, internal process perspective, learning & growth perspective.
- Example: A tech firm evaluates profit, user satisfaction, innovation efficiency, and employee skill development.

---

## **Benchmarking**
- **Benchmarking:** Comparing organizational practices against industry leaders to identify best practices.
- **Benchmark:** The standard of excellence to measure performance.
- Example: A company comparing its customer service response time with Amazon.

---

## **Social Media as a Control Tool**
- Social media platforms can monitor trends, gather feedback, and track performance indirectly.
- Example: During natural disasters, governments use Twitter/Facebook to direct resources and communicate with citizens.

---

## **Global Differences in Control**
- **Distance:** Requires formal reporting structures.
- **Technology:** Enables remote monitoring.
- **Local Laws:** Regulations may constrain controls (e.g., privacy laws).
- **Data Comparability:** Differences in standards across countries.
- **Global Risks:** Disasters or political turmoil may impact control processes.

---

## **Workplace Privacy**
- Employers may monitor emails, calls, and computer activity.
- **Reasons:**
    - Productivity monitoring
    - Preventing offensive material
    - Protecting company secrets

---
