## Ch9 Problem solving and Decision making

#### Meaning of Decision
- A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives. 
- This implies three things:
  - Managers have a purpose in mind when they make a decision. 
  - Managers have alternatives available when they are making a decision.
  - When managers make decisions they are choosing—they are deciding what to do on the basis of some conscious and deliberate logic or judgement.

#### Types of Decisions
- **Programmed and Non-Programmed Decisions:**
  - In the case of programmed decisions, each manager is guided by the same set of rules and policies. The decisions already exist for a repetitive problem.
  - In case of non-programmed decisions for a non-repetitive problem, each manager may bring his own personal beliefs, attitudes and value judgements to bear on the decision process. These decisions involve the wise use of managerial discretion. 


- **Major and Minor Decisions**
  - Degree of Futurity of Decision
  - Impact of the Decision on Other Functional Areas
  - Qualitative Factors that Enter the Decision
  - Recurrence of Decisions
- **Routine and Strategic Decisions:** Routine/tactical decisions have as a primary purpose of achieving as high a degree of efficiency as possible in the company’s ongoing activities. These decisions require little deliberation and money and are taken by managers at lower levels, while strategic decisions impact the direction and state of enterprise. They require lengthy deliberation and large funds and are taken higher levels managers.

- **Sequential and Bear-by-the-Tail decisions**
In a sequential decision, the manager makes a decision one part at a time; when the results of the first part are known, he can use them in deciding the second part and so on. In bear- by –the- tail decisions, once started the manager cannot stop or retrace or defer his/her steps. Instead, he/she has to move ahead.
- **Individual and group decisions **
Individual decisions are taken where the problem is of a routine nature, where the analysis of variable is simple and where definite procedures to deal with the problem already exist. First important and strategic decisions which may result into some change in the organisation are generally taken by a group.
