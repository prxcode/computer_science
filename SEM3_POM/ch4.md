#### Unity of Command Vs Chain of Command
##### Unity of Command
- Each employee should get orders from only one boss.
- It avoids confusion, makes it clear who to listen to, and help employees word better and faster.
- Ex: If you're working in the sales department, you should report **only to the Sales Manager**, not to anyone else.

##### Chain of Command
- It's the line of authority in a company, who reports to whom.
- Structure is like a ladder or tree, from top managers to junior staff.
- It keeps organization organized, everyone knows their role and boss.
- Ex: Employee → Team Leader → Manager → Director → CEO

###### Dual chain of Command
- One employee reports to two bosses. It can create confusion, one boss may see one things, the other says something different.
- It usually in matrix organizations where employees work on multiple projects.
- Ex: An engineer works on a project, so they report to the Project Manager, but they also have a technical boss, the Engineering Manager.

#### Authority

###### Line Authority

#### Responsibility

###### Unity of command

#### Span of Control

##### Decentralized and Centralized

- **Decentralized**: The degree to which lower level employees provide input or actually make decisions.

#### Employee Empowerment
Giving employees more authority to make decisions

#### Formalization
How standardized an organizations's jobs are and the extend to which employee behaviour is guided by rules and procedures.

#### Mechanistic and Organic Structures
1. **Mechanistic Organization:** An organizational design that's rigid and tightly controlled.
- High specilization,, rigid departmentalization, clear chain of cmd, centralized, high formalization.

2. **Organic Organization:** An organization design that's highly adaptive and flexible.
- Cross functional teams, free flow, wide spans, decentralization, low formalization
