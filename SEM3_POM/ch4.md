#### Purposes
Divides work to be done into specific jobs and departments.
- Assign tasks and responsibilities associated with individual jobs.
- Coordinates diverse organizational tasks.
- Clusters jobs into units.
- Establishes relationship among individuals, groups, and departments. Establishes formal lines of authority.
- Allocates and deploys organizational resources.


#### Unity of Command Vs Chain of Command
##### Unity of Command
- Each employee should get orders from only one boss.
- It avoids confusion, makes it clear who to listen to, and help employees word better and faster.
- Ex: If you're working in the sales department, you should report **only to the Sales Manager**, not to anyone else.

##### Chain of Command
- It's the line of authority in a company, who reports to whom.
- Structure is like a ladder or tree, from top managers to junior staff.
- It keeps organization organized, everyone knows their role and boss.
- Ex: Employee → Team Leader → Manager → Director → CEO

###### Dual chain of Command
- One employee reports to two bosses. It can create confusion, one boss may see one things, the other says something different.
- It usually in matrix organizations where employees work on multiple projects.
- Ex: An engineer works on a project, so they report to the Project Manager, but they also have a technical boss, the Engineering Manager.

#### Work Specialization
- Work specialization is breaking down jobs into smaller parts so that each worker does only one specific task.
- Ex: In a car factory, one person install tires, another install engine and another paints the car.
- Everyone does only one job repeatedly, which they become very skilled at.
