##### Hierarchy of Organizational Plans
Vision -> Mission -> Objectives -> Strategies -> Operational Plans

###### Operational Plans
1. **Single use Plan:** Ex: Programers, Budget
2. **Standing Plan:** Ex: Rules, Method


##### Vision Vs Mission

###### Vision: Describes a firms aspiration belief and values
- A vision describes a firm's aspirations, beliefs and values, and shape organization's strategy.
- A vision should be brief, focused and clear to an organization's employees.
- It should be linked to customer's needs and convey general strategy for achieving the mission.

###### Mission: Firms specific area
- Mission is the unique aim of an organization that sets it apart from others of its type.
- It is an organization's specialization in some area—service, product or client, which decides the organization's scope of business.
- A firm’s mission guides the development of strategies. 
- It establishes the context within which daily operating decisions are made and sets limits on available strategic options.


##### Objective
Objective is a specific action or step that you plan to take for achievement of  goals.
###### Types of Objectives
1. Stated Objectives: Official statements of what the organization wants the public to believe.
2. Real Objectives: Objectives that the organization actually pursues. 

##### Policy Vs Procedure

##### Method
A method is a prescribed way in which one step of a procedure is to be performed. 
> If a *procedure* is useful enough we call it **Method.**

- The method that is selected for discharging a particular step under the existing conditions may become outdated in due course of time because of the discovery of better and more economical methods.
- The need for better and more economical methods of operation is great because of the pressure of competition.
- Methods help in increasing the effectiveness and usefulness of the procedure. 

##### Effectiveness Vs Efficiency
###### Effectiveness:
- Doing the right things to achieve your goals.
- Focuses on results or end goals.
- **Example in Management:** A company sets a goal to launch a new product in 3 months, and they successfully do it. That means they are **effective** — they achieved their goal.

###### Efficiency
- Doing things in the right way, using the least amount of resources(time, money, effort).
- Focuses on process and resource use.
- **Example in Management:** If the same company uses **minimum budget**, **less manpower**, and **less time** than expected to launch the product — they are **efficient**.


##### Rules
Rules are detailed and recorded instructions that a specific action must or must not be performed in a given situation.
- Rules bring in predictability.
- A rule is different from a policy, procedure or method. 
- They allow simple screening of violations and legitimize punishment when violated

##### Budget: Financial plan in numeric terms.

##### Goals
- Traditionally, uses managment objectives.
- Provides direction for all managment decisions.

###### SMART Goals
1. Specifc
2. Measurable
3. Achievable
4. Relevant
5. Time-bound

###### Stated Goals Vs Real Goals
- **Stated Goals:** Official statement of what an organization does.
- **Real Goals(Objectives):** Goals that an organization pursues, defined by the actions of members.

##### Management by objectives (MBO):
Management by objectives (MBO): a process of setting mutually agreed-upon goals and using those goals to evaluate employee performance.
- It consists of Overall objectives -> Decisional Objectives -> Department objectives -> Individual Objectives
- MBO involves setting objectives that cascade down through the organization that are translated into operational objectives at each level
- MBO programs have **4** elements: 
	1. Goal specificity, 
	2. Participative decision making, 
	3. An explicit time period, and 
	4. Performance feedback.


##### Limitations of Planning
1. Internal Limitations
	1. Rigidity
	2. Reduce creativity
	3. Time consuming
	4. Costly
	
2. External Limitations
	1. Dynamic Environment
	2. External factors like Natural disasters
	3. Lack of information
