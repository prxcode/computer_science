#### Method
A method is a prescribed way in which one step of a procedure is to be performed. 

- The method that is selected for discharging a particular step under the existing conditions may become outdated in due course of time because of the discovery of better and more economical methods.
- The need for better and more economical methods of operation is great because of the pressure of competition.
- Methods help in increasing the effectiveness and usefulness of the procedure. 


#### Rules
Rules are detailed and recorded instructions that a specific action must or must not be performed in a given situation.
- Rules bring in predictability.
- A rule is different from a policy, procedure or method. 
- They allow simple screening of violations and legitimize punishment when violated


#### Types of Plans
1. **Long-term plans:** plans with a time frame beyond three years
2. **Short-term plans:** plans covering one year or less
3. **Specific plans:** plans that are clearly defined and leave no room for interpretation
4. **Directional plans:** plans that are flexible and set out general guidelines

Management by objectives (MBO): a process of setting mutually agreed-upon goals and using those goals to evaluate employee performance.
- MBO involves setting objectives that cascade down through the organization that are translated into operational objectives at each level

	1. Goal specificity, 
	2. Participative decision making, 
	3. An explicit time period, and 
	4. Performance feedback.

- Establishment of advance plans tends to make administration inflexible
- There is the difficulty of formulating accurate premises
- Planning may sometimes face people’s resistance
